We work with non-profits in managing their digital advertising for them by leveraging our experience with [Google AdGrants][0]. We utilize the grant in very unique ways, targeting the needs of each organization. For some, we focus more on direct donation while others we use the grant to help nonprofits develop larger corporate donors. With our experience we now manage over 7 million dollars in Google Grants. We are a [Google Partner][1] with we are Certified by Google ensuring the highest standards in managing and procuring the Google AdGrant.

We have several non-profits receiving the full benefits of the grant, $10,000 each month. We have been able to increase the average targeted traffic to non-profits' websites by double and for many we provide the vast majority of their traffic. We increase the physical traffic to their fundraisers as well. We have an understanding that goals for non-profits can differ greatly than those of a traditional 'for profit company.' We focus on several main directions to help your organization grow in event marketing, corporate sponsorship, volunteerism, donation development, and cause awareness.
